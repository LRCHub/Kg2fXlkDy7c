Asiatic fever
Asiatic fever
Got the fever
The Asiatic fever

Somebody help me
I got it bad
It's driving me crazy
I'm going mad

I'm turning yellow
My hair's turning black
I'm talking funny
But it's a real snap

It's the Asiatic fever
Burnin burnin through
It's the Asiatic fever
What can I do
It's the Asiatic fever
Burnin burnin through
It's the Asiatic fever
What can I do
I get a good feeling
When my blood starts boiling
And when I go crazy I go crazy
Keep wanting more and more
And more and more

It's the Asiatic fever
Burnin burnin through

It's a lot worse
Than the Asiatic flu
Can't do a thing about it
Tell me what can I do

Burning yes I'm burning
With the Asiatic fever
But I guess I like it
This Asiatic fever

It's the Asiatic fever
Burnin burnin through
It's the Asiatic fever
What can I do
It's the Asiatic fever
Burnin burnin through
It's the Asiatic fever
What can I do
I get a good feeling
When my blood starts boiling
And when I go crazy I go crazy
Keep wanting more and more
And more and more
