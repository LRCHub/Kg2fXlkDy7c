Asiatic fever, Asiatic fever
God the fever, The Asiatic fever
<♪>
Somebody help me
I got it bad
It's driving me crazy
I'm going mad
I'm turning yellow
My hair's turning black
I'm talking funny
But it's a real snap
It's the Asiatic fever
Burnin', burnin' through
It's the Asiatic fever
What can I do
It's the Asiatic fever
Burnin', burnin' through
It's the Asiatic fever
What can I do
I get a good feeling
When my blood starts boiling
And when I go crazy
I can't help wanting
More and more and more
It's the Asiatic fever
Burnin', burnin' through
<♪>
It's a lot worse
Than the Asiatic flue
Can't do a thing about it
Tell me what can I do
Burnin', yes, I'm burnin'
With the Asiatic fever
But I guess I like it
This Asiatic fever
Asiatic fever, Asiatic fever
God the fever, The Asiatic fever
<♪>
It's the Asiatic fever
Burnin', burnin' through
It's the Asiatic fever
What can I do
It's the Asiatic fever
Burnin', burnin' through
It's the Asiatic fever
What can I do
I get a good feeling
When my blood starts boiling
And when I go crazy
I go crazy
Keep me more......
